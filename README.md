# GameBoardRestaurant

This is a project from a C++ class where each group of two had to program a board game
with multiple players. It involves a board game of 8 by 8 squares ith different tiles 
where each player landing on that tile can perform a different action depending on the tile.
The goal is to land on two Palace tiles to get diamonds.
